# xxx_name = item name, can not have spaces
# xxx_path = complete path to the w1_slave file
# xxx_family = optional family code, 'w1_therm' is the only supported and it is also the default
# xxx_longname = longer name, can have spaces
# xxx_description = optional item description

# The 'xxx' part is used to connect the different lines to make a complete item configuration,
# make sure it's unique for every item configured

# Example:
# ow1_item = temp_out_n
# ow1_longname = Outside temp north
# ow1_path = /sys/bus/w1/devices/28-00000514d529/w1_slave
# ow1_description = Outside temperture on the north side
