# xxx_function = input|latched_input|output|counter|tachometer|timer, all inputs have the internal pullup activated
# xxx_item = item name for pin
# xxx_pin = board pin number
# A timer input counts seconds when it is in the active state. The timer can be reset by writing a new value to it
# The active state can be set with xxx_active = 1|0 (only for timer inputs)
#example:
#gpio22_function = counter
#gpio22_item = counter1
#gpio22_pin = 15
