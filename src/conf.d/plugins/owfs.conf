# xxx_item = item name for the owfs sensor value
# xxx_path = [server::]path[:port], default server:port is localhost:4304
# optional:
# when the type is set to COUNTER the owfs path is polled cyclically and the item incremented on every 0->1 transition
# xxx_type = R|R/W|COUNTER, default is R
# xxx_latch = path, make use of the latch when using a ds2406 as input/counter

# examples:
# read the temperature value from the fake sensor available in the default owfs configuration 
#owfs1_item = faketemp
#owfs1_path = 10.67C6697351FF/temperature

# use a ds2460 as counter with support for the input latch
# owfs2_item = ds2460count
# owfs2_path = uncached/12.8D3E7D000000/sensed.A
# owfs2_type = COUNTER
# owfs2_latch = uncached/12.8D3E7D000000/latch.A
