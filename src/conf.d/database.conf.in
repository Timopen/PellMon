[rrd_ds_names]
# This section defines the datasource names used when creating the rrd database,
# "dxx = datasource name". The left value (dxx) is used to match the
# datasource names to the actual data to write to it. The connection
# to data items is made in the "pollvalues" section. Datasource names that
# are not connected to any data item is written as 'undefined'
#
# Three datasources with these exact names: feeder_time, feeder_capacity
# and _logtick must exist, they are used to calculate pellet consumption graphs.
#
# The rrd database is created with the datasources in the order they appear here.
#
# Delete or rename the rrd database file after adding/removing ds-names
# to create a database file with the new definition, or use some other method
# to add the new ds-name to the existing rrd database.
#
# Deleting the rrd database will erase all history.
#
# These defaults are a good start when using the ScotteCom plugin:

d02 = boiler_temp
d03 = chute_temp
d04 = light
d05 = oxygen_desired
d06 = oxygen
d07 = power
d08 = smoke_temp
d09 = feeder_time
d10 = feeder_capacity
d11 = _logtick

[rrd_ds_types]
# Optional rrd data source type definitions for the datasource names in the 
# rrd_ds_names section. If no type is defined for a datasource name the
# default type is used, "DS:%s:GAUGE:%u:U:U", where %s is replaced with the 
# datasource name and %u is replaced with 4*pollinterval
#
# Feeder_time and _logtick must be af type DERIVE/COUNTER, others typically
# use the default type GAUGE
#
d09 = DS:%s:DERIVE:%u:0:U
d11 = DS:%s:COUNTER:%u:U:U

[pollvalues]
# Data values to write to the rrd database.
# "dxx = parameter/data name"
#
# The left value (dxx) is used to match the data item to the RRD data set name
# defined in the "rrd_ds_names" section
#
# The data names are read from the plugins that define them,
# and are written to the rrd database "ds-name" that has a matching "dxx".
# If a data item name defined here does not exist in any plugin, the
# corresponding ds_name in the database is written as "undefined"
#
# The three ds_names feeder_capacity, feeder_time and _logtick must be
# connected to data items with the exact same names.
